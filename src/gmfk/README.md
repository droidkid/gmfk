# GMFK

Some library code that I wrote while writing a game using Heaps.io.

Mainly intended for GameJams.

## Notes 

### Why Heaps/Haxe?

Mainly because of the supporting tools - specifically LDTk and CastleDB. Those tools are fantastic, and I wanted to incorporate these into my GameDev workflow.

That led me to checkout Haxe and Heaps, and I found it intuitive to work with.

### 

### TODOs

- Release v 1.0.0 and publish on Haxelib.
- Write documentation and tutorials.
